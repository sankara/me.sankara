<meta name="description" content="There&#39;s an entire range of depictions when it comes to AI in space-travel themed science-fiction movies and TV shows. Hal, for example, is a conscious AI - for some definition of consciousness. While this is a wonderful plot device and something tech visionaries have been saying is right around the corner, it&#39;s not how I view AI at all.I think the show Expanse got it just right. All the ships and stations are loaded with AIs but you&#39;d never even notice them. It&#39;s subtle. The AI does the job and gets out of the way. Take the example of intercepting missiles with PDCs or firing a rail gun. It&#39;s not a simple or trivial process (and the show goes to great lengths to make that clear as well). There are a huge variety of parameters to consider to keep the ship stable when it&#39;s firing its rail gun. This is space after all and Newton&#39;s third law can be a pita. Counteracting forces - via thrusters - are required in extreme precision to keep the ship from spinning or moving in any of the 3D space.Similarly, the countless other things to monitor in a ship and adjust automatically is the only way space travel would be possible with a reasonable crew. A very minor angle shift could mean the difference between reaching two entirely different planets and nothing&#39;s ever stationery in space.I also found it cool the way the crew interacts with the ship is depicted - a mix of voice commands and gestures and an AI that can interpret what they mean.  At least the way it’s depicted, they can also feed it &quot;high level programming&quot; - like Naomi creating a firing solution.My point is that none of this requires an AGI - Artificial General Intelligence - &quot;just&quot; an AI would do. It’s in by no means a ding. If we could replicate what evolution has taught animals to do, that in itself would be nothing short of a miracle.  If you think about it, a hummingbird with the brain the size of a pea, can flap its wings 53 times a second, maintain near perfect stillness, see things, hear things, dodge obstacles, seek out food and recognise what is good and what is not, identify danger, identify a mate and on and on. And the whole thing operates on a few grams of sugar.">

Alexa/Siri/Google/Cortana on the voice side, Boston dynamics on the whole slew of graceful movements, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_(robot)">robots</a> that replicate human emotions, the increasing autonomous features being built to see the world around us, …etc. I don’t believe the endgame will be a skynet, but rather a whole slew specialised AIs that can do one or more things autonomously by reacting to impulses rather than through a chain of thoughtful decisions.</p>
