keeping yourself up to date with technology?We have become this society where it&#39;s not enough that we do something because
we like it/love it. We want to be the best at it or, more accurately, be better
than the people in your social circle. This has become even more acute with the
free time we have due to the pandemic. We&#39;re don&#39;t appreciate ourselves enought
for what we&#39;ve learnt or achieved in general and especially so during this
trying times.We tend to correlate success with happiness. Ironically, we might find success
if we are happy, and we might be happier if we accept that an average existence
is a mighty good existence.">
