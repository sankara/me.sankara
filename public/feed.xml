With summer here the temperatures are hot, and the need for watering has gone
up. I figured it would be a good idea to setup irrigation to reduce water usage,
even watering and save some time.Even water pressure is much harder to achieve.
The irrigation systems on Amazon
come with 1/4" tubes. The pressure on these fizzle out with just a few atomizers
and sprinklers. The better option would be to run a 1/2" tube as the main line
and use the 1/4" tubes as feeder lines. Even that doesn't work beyond a point
especially when your house uses the same line to feed all faucets and taps.Next up is dealing with the stupid cat that wants to poop in my raised bed. A
net would provide the necessary barrier. I needed a frame to support the
net. This nifty hoops from Amazon
provided a decent frame, and it was extensible. It also doubled as the
supporting frame for the irrigation lines.Here's what it looks like:</description><author>Sankara</author><pubDate>Sun, 13 Jun 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sankara.me/gardening/starting-gardening/</guid><link>https://sankara.me/gardening/starting-gardening/</link><title>Starting a garden</title><description>The past weekend,
with a little help from my friends
, I started a vegetable garden in my backyard. It's been a really long time
since I did anything similar. The choice of what to plant was almost a lottery
pick. Maybe next time I'll learn to identify what makes sense to grow and what
to buy instead. Here are the first sprouts of some of them.CarrotCauliflowerHeirloom Cherry TomatoKohlrabiLavenderMarigoldMintOkraPomegranatePumpkinRadishRomaine LettuceTomatoSunflowerUnknown - Really - Forgot to label - Either basil or tomato or carrotWill share the progress and learnings.</description><author>Sankara</author><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/chasing-success/</guid><link>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/chasing-success/</link><title>Chasing Success</title><description>Human brain has evolved to being lazy [1]. It's the natural state of
things. It is also more likely than not you're average - it's the very
definition of it. In our society, neither of this is adequate.Personally, there's a huge correlation between the rise of social media and the
feeling of inadequacy. Are you adequate in life? Are you married? Do you have a
wife? Do you own a home? Do you have kids? Are you a good parent to your kids?
Do you have friends? Are you a good friend? How many life skills do you know?
How many do you excel at? Can you cook? Do you read? How many books do you read
a year/week? Do you travel? How many countries have you travelled to? Are you a
manager yet? Do you love programming? Do you contribute to open-source? Are you
keeping yourself up to date with technology?We have become this society where it's not enough that we do something because
we like it/love it. We want to be the best at it or, more accurately, be better
than the people in your social circle. This has become even more acute with the
free time we have due to the pandemic. We're don't appreciate ourselves enought
for what we've learnt or achieved in general and especially so during this
trying times.We tend to correlate success with happiness. Ironically, we might find success
if we are happy, and we might be happier if we accept that an average existence
is a mighty good existence.</description><author>Sankara</author><pubDate>Wed, 03 Mar 2021 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/digital-minimalism/</guid><link>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/digital-minimalism/</link><title>Summary of Digital Minimalism</title><description>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy WorldHello, I'm Sankara and I'm a social media and smartphone addict :). Social
media and smartphone are not always recognized as an addiction, at least not
clinically but the result is the same. They consume so much of our time and
influence our mood that at times we could fall behind on the things that
really matter. Even when I read the book I wasn't fully bought into the
philosophy of it. I mean I struggle with a lot of what the author had to say. I
even agree with and have personally seen the way my personal and professional
life is impacted by unchecked social media usage and even quit various social
media platforms as a result. However, I never fully took charge of my digital
life. The whole COVID situation only made it worse. This weekend (August 2020)
is when I finally decided to full on and minimize my phone usage to a minimum.
I'm not quitting everything in rage. I'd still stay connected. However, I'd
be making a clear plan on what I want to use, why and how much and stick to it.Why is too much digital exposure bad?</description><author>Sankara</author><pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2020 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/children-of-time/</guid><link>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/children-of-time/</link><title>Summary of Children of time</title><description>Children of time by Adrian Tchaikovskyhttps://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25499718-children-of-timeChildren of time is a fantastic creative novel by Adrian Tchaikovsky.

The Trance of UnworthinessWe live our world in a trance; inherent in this trance is the belief that no matter how hard we try we are always
falling short. This belief of unworthiness goes hand in hand with the alienation we feel from others and life. The
belief that we are unworthy makes it difficult to trust that we are truly loved. We also assume that our physical
sickness or emotional depression is our own fault.As you go through your day, pause occasionally to ask yourself, “This moment, do I accept myself just as I am?” Without
judging yourself, simply become aware of how you are relating to your body, emotions, thoughts and behaviors. As the
trance of unworthiness becomes conscious, it begins to lose its power over our lives.</description><author>Sankara</author><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/why-do-this/</guid><link>https://sankara.me/wordsmith/why-do-this/</link><title>Why do this?</title><description>What's the motivation behind this blog?Like all ideas that are worthwhile, it came to me out of nowhere that I don't seem
to remember most of the things I read from a book. What's the point of
reading a book if we don't seem to be able to recall anything from it
by the time we reach the end of it? I realized I need a mechanism to
recollect and be able to reference. I already keep highlights and notes on Kindle.
So, why not try to distill them into an essay (or a collection of notes).
This is just an attempt at it.(Of course I also wanted to do this in Clojure and started building
my own blog engine to generate html from markdown and hosting it - Cryogen
had already solved it for me.)</description><author>Sankara</author><pubDate>Wed, 09 Oct 2019 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
