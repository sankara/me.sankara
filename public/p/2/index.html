    <hr /><h2 id="digital-minimalism-choosing-a-focused-life-in-a-noisy-world">Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</h2><p>Hello, I'm Sankara and I'm a social media and smartphone addict :). Social
media and smartphone are not always recognized as an addiction, at least not
clinically but the result is the same. They consume so much of our time and
influence our mood that at times we could fall behind on the things that
really matter. Even when I read the book I wasn't fully bought into the
philosophy of it. I mean I struggle with a lot of what the author had to say. I
even agree with and have personally seen the way my personal and professional
life is impacted by unchecked social media usage and even quit various social
media platforms as a result. However, I never fully took charge of my digital
life. The whole COVID situation only made it worse. This weekend (August 2020)
is when I finally decided to full on and minimize my phone usage to a minimum.
I'm not quitting everything in rage. I'd still stay connected. However, I'd
be making a clear plan on what I want to use, why and how much and stick to it.</p><hr /><h3 id="why-is-too-much-digital-exposure-bad">Why is too much digital exposure bad?</h3>

Since this a summary of a thriller with a suspense
ending, you have to stop reading right now if you don't want to be ruined by a spoiler.</p><blockquote><p>Spoilers!!!
Spoilers!!!
Spoilers!!!</p></blockquote><p>The novel opens with a terraforming project (<em>Brin</em>) in a far away world lead by <em>Dr. Avrana Kern</em>. The goal of the
project is a scientific one - to investigate the possibility of giving intelligence to monkeys by introducing a virus
that accelerates certain desirable characteristics, primarily around cognition. However, this is not well received by
everyone. There's a lot of opposition to it in Earth. Unbeknownst to the crew of the project circling a world many light
years away from Earth, Earth has descended into wars between factions that support terraforming and experimentation and
those that are opposed to it. Also unknown to them is a mole within their ranks that's intent on destroying the entire
vessel and the crew with it.</p>

The Trance of Unworthiness</h3><p>We live our world in a trance; inherent in this trance is the belief that no matter how hard we try we are always
falling short. This belief of unworthiness goes hand in hand with the alienation we feel from others and life. The
belief that we are unworthy makes it difficult to trust that we are truly loved. We also assume that our physical
sickness or emotional depression is our own fault.</p><blockquote><p>As you go through your day, pause occasionally to ask yourself, “This moment, do I accept myself just as I am?” Without
judging yourself, simply become aware of how you are relating to your body, emotions, thoughts and behaviors. As the
trance of unworthiness becomes conscious, it begins to lose its power over our lives.</p></blockquote>
