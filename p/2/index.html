    <p>Human brain has evolved to being lazy <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. It's the natural state of
things. It is also more likely than not you're average - it's the very
definition of it. In our society, neither of this is adequate.</p><p>Personally, there's a huge correlation between the rise of social media and the
feeling of inadequacy. Are you adequate in life? Are you married? Do you have a
wife? Do you own a home? Do you have kids? Are you a good parent to your kids?
Do you have friends? Are you a good friend? How many life skills do you know?
How many do you excel at? Can you cook? Do you read? How many books do you read
a year/week? Do you travel? How many countries have you travelled to? Are you a
manager yet? Do you love programming? Do you contribute to open-source? Are you
keeping yourself up to date with technology?</p><p>We have become this society where it's not enough that we do something because
we like it/love it. We want to be the best at it or, more accurately, be better
than the people in your social circle. This has become even more acute with the
free time we have due to the pandemic. We're don't appreciate ourselves enought
for what we've learnt or achieved in general and especially so during this
trying times.</p><p>We tend to correlate success with happiness. Ironically, we might find success
if we are happy, and we might be happier if we accept that an <em>average existence
is a mighty good existence</em>.</p><hr />

    <hr /><h2 id="digital-minimalism-choosing-a-focused-life-in-a-noisy-world">Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</h2><p>Hello, I'm Sankara and I'm a social media and smartphone addict :). Social
media and smartphone are not always recognized as an addiction, at least not
clinically but the result is the same. They consume so much of our time and
influence our mood that at times we could fall behind on the things that
really matter. Even when I read the book I wasn't fully bought into the
philosophy of it. I mean I struggle with a lot of what the author had to say. I
even agree with and have personally seen the way my personal and professional
life is impacted by unchecked social media usage and even quit various social
media platforms as a result. However, I never fully took charge of my digital
life. The whole COVID situation only made it worse. This weekend (August 2020)
is when I finally decided to full on and minimize my phone usage to a minimum.
I'm not quitting everything in rage. I'd still stay connected. However, I'd
be making a clear plan on what I want to use, why and how much and stick to it.</p><hr /><h3 id="why-is-too-much-digital-exposure-bad">Why is too much digital exposure bad?</h3>

Since this a summary of a thriller with a suspense
ending, you have to stop reading right now if you don't want to be ruined by a spoiler.</p><blockquote><p>Spoilers!!!

Spoilers!!!</p></blockquote><p>The novel opens with a terraforming project (<em>Brin</em>) in a far away world lead by <em>Dr. Avrana Kern</em>. The goal of the
project is a scientific one - to investigate the possibility of giving intelligence to monkeys by introducing a virus
that accelerates certain desirable characteristics, primarily around cognition. However, this is not well received by
everyone. There's a lot of opposition to it in Earth. Unbeknownst to the crew of the project circling a world many light
years away from Earth, Earth has descended into wars between factions that support terraforming and experimentation and
those that are opposed to it. Also unknown to them is a mole within their ranks that's intent on destroying the entire
vessel and the crew with it.</p>
