For as long as I could remember I have assumed that I procrastinate a lot.
On the other hand, if it's something fascinating, I'd find it
extremely hard to stop doing it. There was no in-between. I have also known
that I get distracted by the slightest stimulus and go in a complete tangent.
I'd do well in subjects I like and do pretty poorly in subjects I hate. I've
known that I'd space out a lot. Even when I really want to do something I'd
struggle to do it unless there's an immediate deadline or a payoff.
Surprisingly, I have also been told I'm a good listener - may be because in
reality my head's somewhere else. I could learn by listening to my brother
read (he had the habit of always reading out aloud) but taking the book and
reading it myself was always challenging. And yet somehow, I have done decently
well in school. Although, I still remember the look on my Principal's face when
I told him I got into a decent college. Every one of my teachers thought I had
the "potential" to shine if only I put in my effort.

On the personal and relationships front, I would also say whatever comes to
mind without a filter. Since I could never hold a thought for more than a few
seconds, I'd blurt it out in fear that I'll forget it - only for it to come
across as cutting off someone and being rude. I could also never get social cues
as well as others. I almost faced disciplinary action at work as a result of
something I blurted out. I have missed out on so many dating opportunities
because I didn't understand the social signals well. While I can read people's
reaction to what I do and how it affects but could never predict this over an
impersonal medium like text/email - resulting in a lifelong list of lost
friendships and relationships. The only friendships that lasted are the ones
that really tolerated me and overlooked my infractions. I'd instantly react
emotionally to any criticism or feedback. I could almost never think on my
feet - I distinctly remember this as a kid.

Unfortunately, those with whom you’re interacting don’t necessarily 
know you have ADHD—or understand its role in causing your behavior—
and may see you as immature, self-centered, or egotistical.

The first time I heard the word ADHD was when I was ~30. And even then I
didn't exactly connect with what I understood as ADHD -
hyperactivity/distracted. Neither did I understand how complex ADHD is and
how it extends to emotional intelligence. While I was trying to read books
on Emotional Intelligence and being a better person, I could never apply it
in real-life. All this changed a couple of years ago when I found this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSfCdBBqNXY) on reddit (of all the
places) by [Dr. Russell Barkely](http://www.russellbarkley.org/index.html).
I almost broke down crying realising how much of my life I have wasted
because - academically, professionally & personally. Weirdly, it felt good
to know that there was indeed something wrong with me. Trying to fight this
all my life had been like a disabled person who doesn't know they're
disabled trying to climb a flight of stairs without even a crutch and not
understanding how others seem to have no issues walking up and down the stairs.

The essence of it is that one or more
[executive functions are underdeveloped in people with ADHD](http://www.russellbarkley.org/factsheets/ADHD_EF_and_SR.pdf)

It took me a few months to finally reach out to a psychiatrist and get 
evaluated professionally. And because ADHD can't really be tested physically,
I still continue to doubt I have ADHD. Every time I go back and read the 
symptoms listed in the above-mentioned book and my notes and highlights from 
it I tell myself to take it seriously and seek help. That's what I finally 
did last week. I'm writing this down mostly to remind myself that it's not 
all in my head and there's nothing wrong in getting treated for it. One can 
only hope at my age that I'd at least have a semi-normal life going forward.
