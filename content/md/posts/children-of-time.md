The novel opens with a terraforming project (*Brin*) in a far away world lead by *Dr. Avrana Kern*. The goal of the
project is a scientific one - to investigate the possibility of giving intelligence to monkeys by introducing a virus
that accelerates certain desirable characteristics, primarily around cognition. However, this is not well received by
everyone. There's a lot of opposition to it in Earth. Unbeknownst to the crew of the project circling a world many light
years away from Earth, Earth has descended into wars between factions that support terraforming and experimentation and
those that are opposed to it. Also unknown to them is a mole within their ranks that's intent on destroying the entire
vessel and the crew with it.

The world has been transformed and the animals and virus are ready to be deployed to the world to begin the
experiment. Kern, who has a huge ego, gives a talk thanking the various teams and people responsible for
bringing the project to where it is today and hands it over to Sering for a few words. Sering, the mole from the
anti-science faction, reveals his true intent and sets off the triggers to blow the reactor up and destroy the
vessel. Kern realizing the futility of trying to stop him makes a dash for the pod that was setup for Sering to stay
back and monitor the progress while in a deep hibernation (*"the sleep*). Kern also launches the payload destined for
the planet below - while the virus makes it to the planet, the apes don't make it. As Kern watches from her pod, the
vessel disintegrates. Kern goes into deep cold sleep hoping for a rescue but also uploading a part of her mind forming a
human-computer composite looking for radio signals for both rescue and intelligence in the planet below.

The author then describes the evolution that happens in Spiders as succintly as possible. Two spiders learn to use the
vibrations of their web to communicate and co-ordinate an attach on a prey that's usually too large to tackle by a
single spider alone. This is seen as an effect of the engineered virus that makes the spiders feel more kinship than
they usually do and encourages collaboration among them instead of competition.

Kern is woken up by the computer after about 14 years by the attack of a virus that renders all electronic equipment
useless. Kern's pod is spared by the presence of her uploaded personality. The logical conclusion is that communication
is cut off between Earth and the various colonies and also that the colonies that need the electronic systems to survive
are likely to be wiped out as well. There's very little hope for the future. The computer needs a new directive on when
to wake Kern again. Kern instructs it to wake her up when either a rescue arrives or the planet responds back to the
continuous intelligence test being broadcasted. (It's going to be a long sleep.)
