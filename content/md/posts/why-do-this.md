### _What's the motivation behind this blog?_

Like all ideas that are worthwhile, it came to me out of nowhere that I don't seem
to remember most of the things I read from a book. What's the point of
reading a book if we don't seem to be able to recall anything from it
by the time we reach the end of it? I realized I need a mechanism to
recollect and be able to reference. I already keep highlights and notes on Kindle.
So, why not try to distill them into an essay (or a collection of notes).
This is just an attempt at it.

(Of course I also wanted to do this in Clojure and started building
my own blog engine to generate html from markdown and hosting it - [Cryogen](https://github.com/cryogen-project/cryogen)
had already solved it for me.)
